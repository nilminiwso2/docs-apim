# About this Release

WSO2 API Manager is a platform for creating, managing, consuming, and monitoring APIs. It employs proven SOA best practices to solve a wide range of API management challenges such as API provisioning, API governance, API security, and API monitoring. It combines some of the most powerful and mature components of the WSO2's state-of-the-art Carbon platform to deliver a smooth and end-to-end API management experience while catering to both API publisher and API consumer requirements.

WSO2 API Manager comprises of the following modules:

- **API Publisher**: Allows API creators to design, implement, and document APIs and allows API product managers to manage the lifecycle of APIs and create API products by using one or more APIs.

- **Developer Portal**: A portal for onboarding application creators. It allows application creators to discover, subscribe, test and consume APIs through their applications.

- **API Gateway**: Allows access to APIs/services by routing application traffic to the relevant endpoints. The API Gateway is the component that enforces security, rate-limiting and transformations on API requests while feeding valuable information of these requests to API Analytics.

- **Key Manager**: The security token service of the API Manager which is responsible for handling everything related to authentication and authorization of API requests. It supports a wide variety of security protocols such as OAuth2.0/OIDC, Basic Auth, API Key, SAML based single-sign-on.

- **Traffic Manager**: Controls the traffic flow of the API gateway. This is used to apply request quotas on APIs for monetization, access control or security-related matters. In addition to configuring the available policies, users can deploy their own policies on the traffic manager which will control the rate of traffic on the API gateways.

- **API Analytics**: Monitors all traffic that's routed through the API gateways to analyze usage patterns, SLA violations, consumer behaviors, to provide business insights and so on.
